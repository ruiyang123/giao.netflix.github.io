## 2. Description

The aim of this project is to make some visualisations based on a dataset which consists 
of films and TV shows which have been available on Netflix since 2008.

We found the dataset from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)**. It is collected by a search engine named **[FLixable](https://fr.flixable.com/)**.
 
In this project, we can observe the distribution of TV shows and movies in different country. 
There are 5 figures in total including a geomap, a stacked bar chart, a pie char, a bar char and a line char.

### 3.1 GeoMap

In this figure, we can observe four parts : the geographical map which is colored by the number of TV show and Movies, a legend which shows the color intensity,the left text shows the interval and finally you can find a text in the top which represent the type of the filter. At first, we use no filter. So the number here is the total number of TV shows and movies. If we use a filter for example "TV-14", we will only consider the movies and TV shows satisfies the filter "TV-14". The legend and text will adapt with the filter.

There exist an interaction with the rest 4 plots that means you can move your mouse to a country and click it to add a filter to the rest 4 plots. The rest 4 plots will only consider the data of the country clicked.

This graph shows the distribution of the number TV shows and Movies in diffrent PG(parental guideline) grouped by the Year.
And there exist an interaction with the GeoMap that means you can move your mouse to a category and click it to add a filter to the **GeoMap**
