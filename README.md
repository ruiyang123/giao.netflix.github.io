## Description
The aim of this project is to make some visualisations based on a dataset which consists 
of films and TV shows which have been available on Netflix since 2008.

We found the dataset from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)**. The dataset is not official. It is collected by a search engine named **[FLixable](https://fr.flixable.com/)**.
 
In this project, we can observe the distribution of TV shows and movies in different country. 
There are 5 figures in total including a geomap, a stacked bar chart, a pie char, a bar char and a line char.



## Screenshots

### GeoMap
In this figure, we can observe four parts : the geographical map which is colored by the number of TV show and Movies, a legend which shows the color intensity,the left text shows the interval and finally you can find a text in the top which represent the type of the filter. At first, we use no filter. So the number here is the total number of TV shows and movies. If we use a filter for example "TV-14", we will only consider the movies and TV shows satisfies the filter "TV-14". The legend and text will adapt with the filter.
